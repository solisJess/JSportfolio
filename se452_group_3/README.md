## Project scope: 
- The project developed is a hotel reservation system. A database was built in order for the user to enter from/through dates which would query the data and return results in a table format with a static image, descripion, price, and the abilities to view additional room details or book the room. Once booked, the reservation is saved to a database so that it is searchable by the user if they want to come back. 
## Use case diagram and UML class diagram were both created.
## Moqup was used to develop UI mockups prior to coding the UI. While they are different from the final result, the program functions essentially the same.
