# You will write a program with a welcome message of your choosing 
# The program should take as input the total bill, how many people will be splitting the bill and what percentage tip you'd like to leave. 
# The program should output the amount each person should pay. 
# the input cursor should be on a new line
# This will test your knowledge of working with numbers, converting from one data type to another.
